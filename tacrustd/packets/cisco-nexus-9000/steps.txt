The instructions below were pre PR #148: https://git.soma.salesforce.com/Kuleana/tacrust/pull/148

TODO: Repeat testing of Cisco Nexus 9000 to verify no regression in terms of opening up AuthZ.

    - dir /home

01. login with bad password from aditya [should fail]
02. login with good password from aditya [should succeed]

04. show version [should succeed]
05. show interface [should fail]
06. show clock [this actually fails because shrubbery daemon stops at first match for the "show" command]
07. dir / [should fail]

04. show interface [should fail]
